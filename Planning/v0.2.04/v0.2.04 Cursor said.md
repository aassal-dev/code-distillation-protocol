# v0.2.04 — Consolidation (Claude + Gemini)

**Context:** v0.2.0 was implemented (workflow structure, config, state, checklist, batching, library README, BMAD learnings). v0.2.03 was planned with Gemini (Director / Intent Layer, optional Blueprint Extraction). Gemini had not seen v0.2.0 when planning v0.2.03.

**Decision:** Consolidate into **v0.2.04** so both lines of development live in one version.

- **Keep 100% of v0.2.0:** All config, state, resume, validation, batching, naming, and step structure remain. Nothing from v0.2.0 is removed.
- **Add v0.2.03’s Director as optional Phase 0:** New step-00-director.md; config flag `use_director` toggles 4-phase (Director → Surveyor → Atomizer → Librarian) vs 3-phase (Surveyor → Atomizer → Librarian).
- **Add optional Blueprint Extraction:** When the user provides a theory/Blueprint file, Director can derive learning_objectives from it; Atomizer can add a "Theory vs. Practice" section to artifacts. Documented as an extension so the core pipeline stays single.
- **Single schema and naming:** Everywhere use `target_id` and `abstraction_level` (v0.2.0). Strategy Evaluation updated to describe both 4-phase (with Director) and 3-phase modes and to retain all v0.2.0 scoring.

The full consolidation is in **v0.2.04 Consolidation Plan (v0.2.0 + v0.2.03).md**.
