# Strategic Roadmap & Prioritization

**Version:** 0.2.02

**Status:** Active Master Plan

**Focus:** Goal Alignment, Project Convergence, and DUPARA Pipeline.

## 1. The Convergence of Interests

Based on your historical project logs (AI Agents, News Tech, Unity, Web3, RL/Simulators) spanning from 2020 onwards, your interests are stacked layers of a single overarching vision. We can group them into three macro-pillars:

### Pillar A: The Builder Infrastructure (AI Coding)

- **What it is:** The tools that build the tools. AI-assisted coding frameworks (AgentOS, SpecKit, BMad).
    
- **Your Goal:** Create a hyper-efficient, self-reinforcing system to code your other highly complex technical projects.
    

### Pillar B: The Knowledge Graph (Second Brain & Ingestion)

- **What it is:** The **Ingestion Engine** (managing digital chaos, sifting, prioritizing via **DUPARA** - _Projects, Areas, Roles, Archives_) combined with a Context Engine (Zep, Graphiti).
    
- **The Applications:**
    
    - **Internal:** The Second Brain / Startup OS (A massive context engine resolving your historical research).
        
    - **External:** The **Geo-Temporal Event Simulator (News Hues Tech)**. Moving far beyond a standard news reader, this leverages data sources like GDELT, TABARI, and CAMEO to map global events onto an interactive spatial timeline, tracking real-world people as simulated "actors."
        

### Pillar C: The Spatial/Simulation Layer (AugmentoriaQuest)

- **What it is:** The physical/visual manifestation. Game AI Engines, Unity 3D behavior trees, geometric ML, and spatial scraping.
    
- **The Backbone:** **Smart Blockchain Objects**. Built on years of Reinforcement Learning (CS285) and Unity ML-Agents research. These are ML-trained behavioral capsules (encapsulating physical/animation logic) attached to 3D objects living on-chain. This relies heavily on synthetic data, simulators (Carla), and procedural generation to serve as the ultimate backbone for "Augmentoria Worlds."
    

## 2. The Effective Execution Roadmap

To prevent wandering, you must build the layers in sequential order. _Pillar A builds Pillar B. Pillar B manages Pillar C._

### Phase 1: The Forge (Infrastructure) - _NOW_

- **Focus:** Distillation of AI-Assisted Coding Frameworks.
    
- **Action:** Continue extracting patterns from BMad, AgentOS, and SpecKit into your Pattern Library.
    
- **Milestone:** Use these patterns to build a personalized, hyper-efficient AI coding assistant. You need this to tackle the massive mathematical/architectural requirements of the next phases.
    

### Phase 2: The Filter (Second Brain & Journalism) - _NEXT_

- **Focus:** The Ingestion Engine & Context Engineering.
    
- **Action:** Use the _Blueprint Extraction Protocol_ with books/papers on Knowledge Graphs to analyze `Zep` and `Graphiti`.
    
- **Milestone 1:** Build the **Ingestion Engine**. Connect it to your DUPARA framework to tame your daily research and index your multi-year historical logs (CSVs/Outlines).
    
- **Milestone 2 (Commercial PoC):** Build the **News Hues Geo-Temporal Tool**. This is the perfect stress-test for your Context Engine. If your engine can cross-reference GDELT data and build actor-event timelines, it is robust enough for your Startup OS/Second Brain.
    

### Phase 3: The Simulation (AugmentoriaQuest) - _LATER_

- **Focus:** Game AI, ML-Agents, and Smart Blockchain Objects.
    
- **Action:** Use the _Blueprint Extraction Protocol_ on Game AI Engine books and Reinforcement Learning papers to extract spatial partitioning and behavioral patterns.
    
- **Milestone:** Develop the "Blockchain Capsule" concept—encapsulating physical/visual properties and ML-trained behaviors into an on-chain 3D object for Augmentoria. Integrate Geometric ML to scrape and reconstruct real-world spatial environments (Maps AI Scraper).
    

## 3. Storage and Reuse Strategy (The "Pattern Library")

- Keep storing patterns as Atomic Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdc`) with strict YAML tags.
    
- As you build the **Ingestion Engine** in Phase 2, its _very first job_ will be to ingest, map, and organize your Pattern Library into a searchable Knowledge Graph, linking it to your years of historical CSV research.
