# The Blueprint Extraction Protocol (Theory-Guided Distillation)

**Version:** 0.2.03

**Type:** Protocol Extension (Addresses Thread 4 & The Intent Layer)

**Purpose:** Using authoritative texts (Books/Papers) to guide the AI in extracting specific domain implementations from a codebase.

## The Concept

Instead of asking the AI to "find what's interesting" (Unsupervised), we provide a theoretical framework and ask the AI: _"Show me exactly how this codebase implements Theory X"_ (Supervised).

_Note: In the v0.2.03 architecture, this Blueprint serves as the ultimate high-level input for Phase 1: The Director._

## Prerequisites

1. **The Codebase:** Cloned locally (e.g., `Zep` repo).
    
2. **The Blueprint:** A pre-processed Markdown file summarizing a book chapter or research paper (e.g., `theory_knowledge_graphs.md`).
    

## The Prompt Workflow

### Step 1: Context Injection (The Director Phase)

_In Cursor Composer, provide both the Blueprint file and the target Codebase directory. Instruct the Director to use the Blueprint to establish the learning goals._

### Step 2: The "Mapping" Prompt (The Surveyor Phase)

> **Prompt:**
> 
> "I have provided a theoretical blueprint named `[theory_file.md]`. It describes the standard architectural and algorithmic concepts for `[Domain, e.g., Context Engineering]`.
> 
> I want you to act as a **Bridge Engineer**. Your job is to map the theory from the book to the reality of the `[Target Repo Name]` codebase.
> 
> **Task:**
> 
> 1. Read the core concepts in the Blueprint.
>     
> 2. Scan the codebase and find the exact files and functions where these specific concepts are implemented.
>     
> 3. Analyze the gap: Did the developers follow the book exactly? Did they optimize it? Did they use a clever workaround?
>     
> 
> **Output:** Create an `implementation_map.json` linking the Theoretical Concept to the exact File Path and Line Level."

### Step 3: The "Blueprint Atomizer" Prompt (The Atomizer Phase)

> **Prompt:**
> 
> "Using the `implementation_map.json`, extract the patterns into our standard Atomic Artifacts.
> 
> However, add a new section to the artifact called **'Theory vs. Practice'**.
> 
> Explain how the textbook theory was adapted for real-world production in this specific codebase.
> 
> Save each finding as `_distillation/library/domain_[concept_name].md`."

### Step 4: The Librarian Phase

_(Run the standard Phase 4 Librarian prompt to merge, tag, and index these theory-guided findings into your Global Library)._

## Why this is devastatingly effective:

It removes AI hallucination and "noise." By constraining the AI's search parameters to a textbook's index, you force it to find the highest-quality, most heavily engineered parts of the codebase. You are essentially generating an interactive, real-world companion guide to any textbook you read.
