This is an excellent architectural addition. You are essentially adding an **"Intent Layer"** (or a **"Director"**) to the system.

Before, the system was a "bottom-up" explorer: it scanned the code to see what was complex. By injecting this new layer, we are creating a **"Top-Down" hybrid**. The system reads the human-readable docs (README, marketing copy, high-level theory) to understand the _purpose_ of the tool, generates specific learning hypotheses, and _then_ sends the agents to hunt for how those hypotheses were coded.

This bridges the gap perfectly between "wandering" and your highly structured "Blueprint Extraction Protocol."

I have updated the three core protocol documents to **v0.2.03**.

1. **`strategy_evaluation.md`**: Updated to reflect the new 4-stage architecture.
    
2. **`distillation_workflow.md`**: Inserted the new **Phase 1: The Director**, pushing the others down.
    
3. **`cursor_master_prompts.md`**: Added the specific prompt to drive this new "Goal-Setting" component.
