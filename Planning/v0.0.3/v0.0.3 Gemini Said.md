This is a significant maturation of the idea. You are moving from a manual "research task" to an **Automated Industrial Pipeline**.

I have incorporated your feedback:

1. **Versioning Reset:** All files are now **v0.0.3**.
    
2. **Ecosystem Research:** I added a section comparing this to `.mdc` (Claude's Model Context Protocol files), `.cursorrules`, and "Skills." The key insight: **Skills are verbs (tools), but your Library is the Brain (wisdom).**
    
3. **Fractal Optimization:** The prompts now explicitly scan four levels of abstraction: **System -> Module -> Class -> Line**.
    
4. **The Workflow Engine:** I created a new file, `distillation_workflow.md`, which acts as the "Game Loop." It explicitly names the outputs of Step 1 (`map.json`) to be consumed by Step 2, enabling parallel agent execution.
    

Here is the complete v0.0.3 suite.
