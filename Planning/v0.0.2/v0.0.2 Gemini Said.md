I love the shift in thinking here. You are moving from a **"Book Report"** model (summarizing a repo into one doc) to a **"Trading Card"** model (extracting atomic, collectible, reusable units of knowledge).

This is a superior architectural decision. If we dump everything into one `.cursorrules` file, it becomes a messy "God Object" of rules. If we break them into atomic units, you can **compose** a new project's DNA by simply dragging and dropping specific "Pattern Cards" from your global library.

I have updated all three files to reflect this **Atomic/Modular Strategy** and added Semantic Versioning (v1.1.0) to track our changes.

Here are the updated artifacts.

### Key Changes Summary (v1.1.0):

1. **Separation of Concerns:** We no longer mix "Strategy Evaluation" with "Templates."
    
2. **Atomic Design:** The templates now represent **Individual Files** with metadata (YAML headers). This is crucial for your "Universal Library" idea. You can now grep/search these tags (`tags: [react, performance]`) across your entire library.
    
3. **The "AI Rule" Section:** Inside each atomic file, there is a dedicated section meant to be copy-pasted (or read) by Cursor. This satisfies your requirement to have granular AI instructions that can be composed later.
    
4. **Context Strategy:** The Prompts now explicitly differentiate between "Reconnaissance" (cheap) and "Atomizer" (deep) phases to manage credit consumption.
    

**Next Step Recommendation:** Create a folder named `_knowledge_bank` on your machine. Run **Phase 1** prompt on a repo. Then, pick **one** complex file, run **Phase 2**, and save the output as `_knowledge_bank/pattern_example.md` using the new template. Check if the "AI Rule" section is clear enough for Cursor to understand in a new project.
