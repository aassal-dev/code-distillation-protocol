# The Codebase Distillation Prompts

**Version:** 0.0.2

**Focus:** Modular, Atomic Extraction.

These prompts are designed to extract specific, isolated units of knowledge rather than a monolithic report.

## Phase 1: The Reconnaissance (Map)

_Goal: Find where the treasure is buried without burning tokens on dirt._

> **Prompt:**
> 
> "Act as a Lead Architect. I need a high-level map of [Repo Name] to decide where to focus our deep analysis.
> 
> 1. **Tech Stack & Core Libs:** What powers this?
>     
> 2. **Nerve Centers:** List the top 5 directories or files where the _hard_ engineering happens. (Ignore CRUD/Boilerplate).
>     
> 3. **Context Clues:** Based on file names/comments, what seems to be the most complex problem this repo solves?
>     
> 
> **Output:** A short summary. Do not generate full documentation yet."

## Phase 2: The Atomizer (Extraction)

_Goal: Extract distinct patterns into separate, reusable units. Run this on specific "Nerve Centers" identified in Phase 1._

> **Prompt:**
> 
> "Focus on [Specific File/Folder]. I want you to extract **Atomic Patterns** and **Tricks** from this code.
> 
> **The Rule of Atomicity:**
> 
> Do not write a single report. For each distinct pattern, trick, or architectural decision you find, imagine you are creating a 'Trading Card' for a developer library.
> 
> **For each discovery, generate a separate Markdown block (or file) containing:**
> 
> 1. **Metadata:** ID, Tags, Complexity (Low/Med/High).
>     
> 2. **The Hook:** What problem does this solve?
>     
> 3. **The Human Insight:** A brief explanation of the 'Why' and the cleverness behind it.
>     
> 4. **The AI Rule:** A formal instruction block (like a `.cursorrule`) that I can use to instruct an AI to replicate this pattern in the future.
>     
> 
> **Look for:**
> 
> - **Architectural Patterns:** (e.g., 'The Store Factory', 'The Adapter Bridge').
>     
> - **Micro-Optimizations:** (e.g., 'Buffer Pooling', 'Lazy Hydration').
>     
> - **DX Wins:** (e.g., 'Type-Safe API Wrappers')."
>     

## Phase 3: The Context-Enricher (The "Why")

_Goal: Use GitHub MCP or Issue search to deepen the understanding of a specific atom._

> **Prompt:**
> 
> "I have identified a pattern: [Pattern Name/Description].
> 
> Using your available tools (GitHub MCP, Search, or knowledge base), look for:
> 
> 1. **Why** was this introduced? (Search closed PRs or Issues with keywords related to this pattern).
>     
> 2. **Alternatives considered:** Did they try something else that failed?
>     
> 
> Add this 'Historical Context' to the pattern documentation."
