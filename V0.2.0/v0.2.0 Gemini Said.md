# v0.2.0 Gemini Said — Self-Modification Meta-Note

**Context:** The Knowledge Extraction system was self-modified from v0.1.0 to v0.2.0 using learnings from BMAD-METHOD workflows and from the **extracted pattern library** in `_distillation/patterns` (the 50 pattern files and README produced by running the extraction protocol on BMAD).

---

## What we applied

- **BMAD workflow architecture:** Micro-file workflow (one workflow.md + steps/step-NN-name.md), config-driven paths (workflow.yaml with extraction_root, output_plan, output_findings, output_library, validation), and clear MANDATORY RULES / CONTEXT BOUNDARIES / YOUR TASK / DISCOVERY SEQUENCE in each step.
- **State and resume:** Introduced extraction-state.json (current_phase, targets_done, findings_count, last_updated) so we can resume from Phase 2 without re-surveying; optional batches_completed and discarded_common_knowledge_count.
- **Validation checklist:** Added checklist.md for plan mix of abstractions, finding/pattern filenames and frontmatter, no common-knowledge in library, library README present and updated. Run after Phase 3; do not delete findings until library is written and validated.
- **Write-as-you-go and context hygiene:** Phase 2 writes each finding immediately and optionally updates state; batching by directory or abstraction when many targets to avoid accumulating full content in context.
- **Single source of truth:** One extraction_plan schema (target_id, path, focus, abstraction_level); one finding/pattern template (YAML + Problem/Solution/Code/AI Rule); one Standardized Output Templates doc referenced by Atomizer and Librarian.
- **Quality gate and tag index:** Librarian explicitly discards common-knowledge findings and records count; library/README.md with summary counts, semantic tag categories table, file naming, quick lookup by topic (aligned with distillation/patterns/README.md).
- **Naming and schema consistency:** target*id and abstraction_level in the plan; pattern output requires source_path, quality (cunning|novel|masterful), and pattern*<kebab-name>.md filenames.
- **Two-tier and find-config-resolve-path-discover:** Init order: find config (workflow.yaml) → resolve paths → discover existing plan/state. No assumed hardcoded paths.
- **Patterns from the distillation library:** find-config-resolve-path-discover, two-tier-handler-loading (config then defaults), ensure-initialized / propagate config, manifest-as-source-of-truth, recursive-scan-with-exclude-paths, clean-for-csv-orchestration (fixed order, critical options), file-based step registry (steps/step-\*.md), centralized-flat-naming, composition-root orchestrator, ordered-template-pipeline, object-hasown for variable lookup, compound-trigger / single-schema mindset. The extraction system itself now follows the same patterns it produces.

## Outcome

v0.2.0 is a concrete file set under `0 Knowledge Extraction/V0.2.0/`: workflow.yaml, workflow.md, steps/step-01-survey.md, step-02-atomize.md, step-03-librarian.md, checklist.md, extraction-state.schema.md, v0.2.0 Standardized Output Templates, v0.2.0 Prompts, v0.2.0 Orchestrator, v0.2.0 Strategy Evaluation, and this meta-note. Root CHANGELOG.md records v0.1.0 and v0.2.0. The system can be run in-editor as before, with optional resume and validation, and is ready for a future automated runner that parses workflow.yaml and steps.
