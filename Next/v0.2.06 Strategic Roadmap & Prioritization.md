# Strategic Roadmap & Prioritization

**Version:** 0.2.06

**Status:** Active Master Plan

**Focus:** Goal Alignment, Project Convergence, and DUPARA Pipeline.

## 1. The Convergence of Interests

Based on your historical project logs (AI Agents, News Tech, Unity, Web3, RL/Simulators), your interests are stacked layers of a single overarching vision. We can group them into three macro-pillars:

### Pillar A: The Builder Infrastructure (AI Coding)

- **What it is:** The tools that build the tools. AI-assisted coding frameworks.
    
- **Current Status:** **MATURE BUT EVOLVING.** The Knowledge Extraction Workflow (v0.2.05) with state-management, batching, and YAML-configuration serves as a production-grade extraction engine, but continues to upgrade itself via continuous harvesting.
    

### Pillar B: The Knowledge Graph (Second Brain & Ingestion)

- **What it is:** The **Ingestion Engine** (managing digital chaos, sifting, prioritizing via **DUPARA**) combined with a Context Engine.
    
- **The Applications:**
    
    - **Internal:** The Second Brain / Startup OS (resolving historical CSV/Text research).
        
    - **External:** The **Geo-Temporal Event Simulator (News Hues Tech)**. Leveraging GDELT/TABARI to map global events onto an interactive spatial timeline.
        

### Pillar C: The Spatial/Simulation Layer (AugmentoriaQuest)

- **What it is:** The physical/visual manifestation. Game AI Engines, Unity 3D behavior trees, geometric ML.
    
- **The Backbone:** **Smart Blockchain Objects**. ML-trained behavioral capsules attached to 3D objects living on-chain. Relies heavily on synthetic data and simulators (Carla).
    

## 2. The Effective Execution Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Forge & Harvest (Infrastructure & Library Growth) - _ACTIVE EXECUTION_

- **Focus:** Continuous distillation of diverse AI-Assisted Coding Frameworks (AgentOS, Cloud Task Master AI, SpecKit, OpenSpec, Beads/GasTown) coupled with iterative engine upgrades.
    
- **Action:** Run the state-aware extraction engine on these additional frameworks. Create a feedback loop: use the newly extracted patterns to continuously fortify, reinforce, and grow the extraction engine itself (replicating the success of the BMAD -> v0.2.05 upgrade).
    
- **Next Action:** Once the library is sufficiently enriched and cross-pollinated, build the **"Injector Protocol"**—a Context Assembler system to retrieve these diverse patterns and inject them automatically into your new coding environments.
    

### Phase 2: The Filter (Second Brain & Journalism) - _NEXT_

- **Focus:** The Ingestion Engine & Context Engineering.
    
- **Action:** Point the mature extraction engine at `Zep` or `Graphiti`. Ensure `use_director: true` and set the `blueprint_file` to point to theoretical texts on Knowledge Graphs.
    
- **Milestone 1:** Build the **Ingestion Engine**. Connect it to your DUPARA framework to index your multi-year historical logs (CSVs/Outlines).
    
- **Milestone 2 (Commercial PoC):** Build the **News Hues Geo-Temporal Tool**. Stress-test the Context Engine by cross-referencing GDELT data to build actor-event timelines.
    

### Phase 3: The Simulation (AugmentoriaQuest) - _LATER_

- **Focus:** Game AI, ML-Agents, and Smart Blockchain Objects.
    
- **Action:** Use the _Blueprint Extraction Protocol (add-on)_ on Game AI Engine books and Reinforcement Learning papers to extract spatial partitioning and behavioral patterns from open-source simulators.
    
- **Milestone:** Develop the "Blockchain Capsule" concept.
    

## 3. Storage and Reuse Strategy

- **Storage:** Patterns are successfully stored as Atomic Markdown files with strict YAML tags per the standardized templates.
    
- **Reuse:** We must develop an automated retrieval script (The Context Assembler / Injector) at the end of Phase 1 to query the `library/README.md` tag index and inject patterns into active development workspaces.
