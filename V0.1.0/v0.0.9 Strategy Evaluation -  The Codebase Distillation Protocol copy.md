This is a fantastic "meta-move." You are going to dogfood the protocol on a high-level agentic framework (BMad) to extract patterns that will help you build a better agentic framework (your Distillation Protocol). It’s a self-reinforcing loop.

Since we are freezing the protocol at **v0.0.4**, I will generate the final "Release Candidate" set of files. I've done a final polish to ensuring the `distillation_workflow.md` is perfectly formatted for copy-pasting into Cursor Composer.

Here is your frozen **v0.1.0** release of the Codebase Distillation Protocol.

### Next Steps: The "BMad" Dogfood Run

1. **Open the BMad repo** in Cursor.
    
2. **Press Cmd+I** (Composer).
    
3. **Paste** the content of `distillation_workflow.md` (the second file above).
    
4. **Execute.**
    

The output will be a set of atomic "Pattern Cards" in `_distillation/library/`. You can then read those cards to see how BMad handles multi-agent orchestration, and potentially use those very patterns to write a "V2" of this distillation script (e.g., if BMad has a better way of handling parallel agent tasks than my simple loop).
