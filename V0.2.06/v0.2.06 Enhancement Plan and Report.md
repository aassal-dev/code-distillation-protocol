name: Knowledge Extraction v0.2.06 Enhancements
overview: Plan major enhancements to the Code Distillation Protocol (Knowledge Extraction) for v0.2.06 by applying feedback from the v0.2.05 OpenClaw 72-LT run, the existing 95-pattern library (OpenClaw + BMAD), and the v0.2.06 Plan documents. Delivers one coherent v0.2.06 release focused on pattern stand-alone quality, merge traceability, and artifact consistency.

# Knowledge Extraction System — v0.2.06 Enhancement Plan

## Session completed: repo and release setup

- [x] **GetRepo.md** — Created at repo root of Code Distillation Protocol (Knowledge Extraction). Documents: clone URL, branch model (main = Planning + merged versions; one folder per version, one branch per version), workflow for new versions (create merge branch from main, add V0.2.xx folder, push, merge to main when ready).
- [x] **main** — Pushed with GetRepo.md, Planning (Resources, v0.2.06 Plan), and V0.2.05 README/workflow/checklist updates. Planning remains part of main.
- [x] **v0.2.06 branch** — Created from main, full V0.2.06 folder added (workflow, steps, checklist, templates, prompts, merge-map, code completeness), committed and pushed to `origin/v0.2.06`.
- [x] **Plan report** — This plan updated with results and summary; copy added to protocol repo v0.2.06 branch and pushed.

### Summary

GetRepo and branch model are in place: every version has its own folder (V0.2.xx) and its own branch (v0.2.xx); Planning stays on main; new versions use a merge branch (create branch, add version folder, push, then merge to main). v0.2.06 release content is on branch `v0.2.06` and can be merged to main via PR when ready.

## Version decision: v0.2.06 (single release)

All requested changes are cohesive and can ship as **v0.2.06**. A split into v0.2.06 (quality gate) and v0.2.07 (merge traceability) is only justified if you want to implement and validate the Code-completeness rules first, then add merge-map and concept_id in a follow-up. This plan assumes one release; implementation can still be phased.

**Why not higher minor (e.g. 0.3.0)?** No phase count change, no new config schemas beyond optional frontmatter and one optional artifact (merge-map). The protocol_v0.2.05 plan reserved 0.2.10 for "structured XML instructions, CSV-driven modes, full workflow-map as first-class doc"; those are out of scope here.

## 8. Implementation order (suggested) — all done

- [x] 1. **Template + Atomizer** — Add `code_completeness` and Code section rules; update prompts and step-02.
- [x] 2. **Checklist** — Director LT proportionality; Pattern Code completeness; merge-map item.
- [x] 3. **Librarian** — Merge-map output; optional Code enrichment; primary source / "Also derived from"; README quick-lookup and tagging guideline.
- [x] 4. **Surveyor** — Optional `concept_id` in plan schema and discovery sequence.
- [x] 5. **Director** — Proportional LT count; update step-00 and Director prompt.
- [x] 6. **Workflow/orchestrator** — Batch ordering note; Phase 3 output (merge-map); version 0.2.06.
