Hello! First, I would like you to update the GetRepo for the knowledge extraction system. I would like to remind you that every version in its own should be in its own folder, and it should be in its own branch, right, except the planning folder, which should be part of the main. Please stop talking about what you did, so please create a merge branch for each new version and push it, and update that.
